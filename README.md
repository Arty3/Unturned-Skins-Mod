<h1 align="center">‚ú® Unturned Skins Mod ‚ú®</h1>

<h6 align="center"><em>Unturned patch which provides extensive skin utilities</em></h6>

## üìù Overview

This "mod" (more of a game patch) provides you with extensive skin utilities for [Unturned](https://store.steampowered.com/app/304930/Unturned/), which allow you to create any skin combination of your choice, simulate skin crafting, view and use the generated skins in-game through an integrated skin menu UI within the game, designed to look like a vanilla game UI. It also supports the original box opening and crafting menus, removing country restrictions which would normally prevent you from doing so.

## ‚ö† Known Issues

- Crafting buttons scale poorly with UI scale
- Only works without Battleye (Intended)
- Hardcoded skin effects (Has to be done)
- Crafting achievement skins (Hopefully fixed soon)
- Generated skins not persisting when returning to main menu
- Head only effects wont work on non head items (e.g. Sacrificial on a gun)
- Cosmetic particle tags stay in skin menu
- Ctrl click (use) doesn't apply particle effect for cosmetics (Use `Use` button instead).

###### Note that this is still very much a work in progress!

## üõ† Technical Disclaimers

This project was made with Windows in mind. It won't support MacOS or Linux systems.

Nelson has been working on a UI overhaul for the game for years at this point. It likely won't be released any time soon, but it is a possibility to keep in mind.

Because Nelson keeps the skin generation logic on the server side (for obvious reasons), this project isn't very maintainable due to a large number of hardcoded things which are simply not dynamically resolvable on the client side at runtime. Therefore, for future updates, additional effects will need to be hardcoded.

Nelson does put effort into server sided backwards compatibility, however, not on the client side. Therefore it could be that an update breaks things by changing client side logic.

I've added several checks for this within the code, if you find one, please feel free to report it.

Box opening simulations aren't included, since it would require a significant amount of hardcoding valid effects for each box (e.g. Divine not being available anymore).

The code isn't very maintainable and / or scalable. It is currently a very early version, and I didn't include much effort into making the code scalable / maintainable. The goal was more to get a working product. I won't set up collaboration support, however, if you do so decide to improve the project please let me know (See [contacting me](#alternatively-find-me-here)) and I'll be sure to review it and credit you!
